# All explores and tables here are from system__activity model.
# In this README, the words "view" and "table" are used interchangebly.
# Examples are looked from the view dashboard_layout.
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The top level name is the explore_name. i.e. dashboard
# The 2nd level name is the view_name. Also BigQuery table name i.e. dashboard_layout
# Within the view_name is the attributes of the view
# - model: model_name containing the view
# - view: When running Looker query API to extract data, this view must be used in the
#         "view" parameter to get data for this view_name. Data in this field may be
#          different from the view_name. i.e. dashboard
# - view_display_name: The name of this view as you can see on Looker UI
#                      when going to Explore mode
# - explore_name: The name of the explore containing this view
# - explore_display_name: The name of the explore as you can see on Looker UI
#                         when going to Explore mode
# - primary_key: table primary key, used in BigQuery to perform MERGE DDL command.
#                 primary_key can be a string with table name
#                 and schema field name (i.e. dashboard_layout.id) or a list of
#                 schema field name only (i.e. ["user_id","role_id"] for user_facts_role)
# - possible_cursor_field: The list of datetime columns that can be picked to use
#                 as a cursor field
# - cursor_field: Name of the column to be used as cursor field. A cursor field is a
#                 timestamp type column in the table. It can be used to filter
#                 records after a certain time. This is used to perform incremental load.
#                 If cursor_field is null, it means the table does not have a field to
#                 filter records. Extraction will always extract all records.
#                 If you want to leave cursor_field null, make sure the total number of
#                 records is lower than the ROW_LIMIT in Workflow `main-extract-looker`
# - fields: List of dimensions that can be extracted from the view
# - schema: List of columns in BigQuery table. IMPORTANT: the order of columns in "schema"
#           should match the order of columns in "fields".
#           Each column contains these fields:
#           - name: Column name in BigQuery table
#           - type: Column data type in BigQuery table
#           - description: Column description in BigQuery table. Taken from the API
