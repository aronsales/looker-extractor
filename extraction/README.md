# EXTRACTION SCRIPTS
this is an application for the Looker Hackathon 2024.



## setting up & installtion
1. make sure your workdir is `extraction` : `cd extraction`

2. Create virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Configuring `looker.ini`

To create `looker.ini`, copy `looker-sample.ini`, rename to `looker.ini` and fill in the required values. The values for client_id and client_secret can be retrieved by navigating to https://<your_looker_endpoint>/admin/users, editing your user, editing API3 keys, and clicking the "reveal" button to view your client_id and client_secret. If there are currently no API3 credentials, they can be generated by clicking “New API3 Key.”

For your own source code repositories, be sure to configure your version control system to ignore the SDK configuration .ini file so it doesn't accidentally get published somewhere unauthorized people can see it.

## usage

`python main.py --explore user --table user`

this will generate a csv file with the data from the user table in system activity.
the file will be dumped to `out` directory.
