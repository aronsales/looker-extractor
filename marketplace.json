          \n - LookML fields that are never queried by users
          \n - LookML field usage with Dashboard/Look/ Source granularity
          \n - Custom dimensions, measures, table calculations that are used repeatedly
          \n - Fields that do not follow LookML best practices
          \n - Fields that are mostly used in filters
          \n - Fields in the longest-running queries"
